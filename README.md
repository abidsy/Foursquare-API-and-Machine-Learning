## Foursquare API and Machine Learning
This project was completed as the capstone project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The raw python code and a jupyter notebook are both included.

Data was scraped from the Foursquare API and various machine learning methods were applied using scikit-learn. 

I originally completed the course during 2019 and my credentials can be found here: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/8V6PFLHL72TN
